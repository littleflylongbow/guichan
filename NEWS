2004-12-17 Third Beta release!

Here comes a new version of Guichan! This could be seen as
a "half release" of sorts, there were some things we would have
liked to put in this release, but didn't. We felt it was more
important to get a new version out before christmas, as a lot of
bugs had been fixed. See the ChangeLog for further details.

Big thanks goes to Thorbjørn Lindeijer and the rest of 
"The Mana World"-team for helping in finding bugs, and suggesting
API improvements (that you probably will see implemented in 0.3.0)

2004-09-24 Second Beta release!

Ten days after the first Beta comes the second which contains
some improvments, bug fixes and new implementations. For a 
complete list of changes, check out the ChangeLog.
