* Added an "addons" directory in the distrobution. It will contain
  usefull classes with Guichan that are not compiled into the library.
  They are not compiled because they need dependencies other then 
  Guichans or are to specific. For now, "addons" only contain one
  class, SDLTrueTypeFont giving True Type Font abilities to Guichan
  through the SDL_ttf library and hence will only work with SDLGraphics.
  SDLTrueTypeFont was contributed by Walluce Pinkham (and edited by us).
  Thank you Walluce!
* Added getColor function in Graphics. Implemented in SDLGraphics, 
  AllegroGraphics and OpenGLGraphics.
* Fixed a problem with the DropDown widget. When the widget was focused
  with a mouse press, you couldn't select elements with up and down keys.
* Merged drawText, drawTextCenter and drawTextRight into one function
  drawText which takes an alignment parameter (thanks Ted!).
  Widgets taking advantage of this are Button and Label.
* As a result of the added border support, almost every widget have 
  been changed for the better, e.g removal of offsets.
* Added support for borders. This is a major API change introducing
  some new functions to Widget.	
* Examples are now a part of the documentation generated by
  doxygen.

* TextBox doesn't draw its caret if its not editable.
* Better exception with more information in ImageFont,
  added row spacing and glyph spacing functions.
* Fixed problem in ImageFont when loading a corrupt file.
  It will now throw an exception (thanks Terin!).
* Implemented _getRawData() in AllegroImageLoader.
* Fixed Image. It is now overloadable. 
* DropDown sets the colors for its internal widgets if they are
  not custom widgets (not given to the DropDown by the user).
* Now all default widgets respect the alpha channel in the colors.
* Non focusable widgets will now not recieve key input ever.
  In previous version, focused widgets would still remain focused
  after setting them to not be focusable.
* Moved tab handling from Gui to the FocusHandler.

  Widgets can now have different behaviours on tab in and tab out.
  The old setTabable is equivalent to setTabInEnabled.

  drawing primitives
