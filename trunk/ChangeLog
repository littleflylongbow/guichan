* DropDown sets the colors for its internal widgets if they are
  not custom widgets (not given to the DropDown by the user).
* Now all default widgets respect the alpha channel in the colors.
* Non focusable widgets will now not recieve key input ever.
  In previous version, focused widgets would still remain focused
  after setting them to not be focusable.
* Moved tab handling from Gui to the FocusHandler.
* Splitted setTabable to setTabInEnabled and setTabOutEnabled.
  Widgets can now have different behaviours on tab in and tab out.
  The old setTabable is equivalent to setTabInEnabled.
* isVisisble now checks if parent is visible
* Added alpha channel support in AllegroGraphics for
  drawing primitives
* Added experimental alpha channel support in SDLGraphics
  for 32 bpp
* Added full alpha channel support in OpenGLGraphics
* Fixed OpenGL graphics to disable GL_LIGHTNING before draw
* Fixed container problem. Nonvisible widgets no longer
  recieves mouse input.
* Fixed mouse out problem with SDLInput
* Fixed alpha problem with the SDLImageLoader
